#### Explain things in simple language whenever possible, keeping jargon and technical language to a minimum
"As simple as possible, but no simpler" should be our guiding principle. 

❌"な is an adnominal copula"
Not simple enough.
Contains too much jargon and could readily be explained in everyday language.

❌"The first group is called ru-verbs"
Overly simplified.
Frequently leads to confusion.

#### Introduce precisely one new language mechanic per lesson

For the purpose of this guide, a "mechanic" can refer to a variety of things:
- A particle with only one usage (i.e. へ)
- One particular usage of a particle with multiple distinct usages, i.e.
	- を as the "object" marker
	- を to mark an area for traversal
- Set phrases and patterns, i.e.
	- ～たことがある
	- わけにはいけない

"Incremental" in this sense means that new mechanics are only taught once all of their dependent mechanics have already been taught.
- We don't teach you about には until you know about both に and は.
- We don't teach you about に until you know what verbs are.

In some cases, it may be useful to teach two related concepts at once; for example, 内外, or the "spontaneous/intentional" dichotomy of にする・になる. In cases like this, the topic of the article should be those collective concepts themselves, and not the individual parts. Needless to say, any dependencies of these articles should have been already introduced as well.

#### Use native examples 100% of the time
Prioritize examples from beginner-friendly material, and link to that material from the lessons.

For example:

>冷たい！
it's cold!
>  
Flying Witch, vol. 1, page 4

#### Get people reading as early as possible
The goal of the guide is for people to *stop using the guide.* Long-winded explanations and trivia are contrary to that goal. Explain the grammar simply and intuitively, show plenty of native examples, and keep moving along. 

Always be asking yourself "will *not* knowing this information get in the way of someone starting to read beginner material?"

If the answer is "no", reconsider including it.
