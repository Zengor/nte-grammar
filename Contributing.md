# Callouts
Use callout blocks to color-code certain types of information. Include a custom title for types other than "warning".

>[!question]- Answer
>Use *collapsed* "question" callout blocks below example sentences to show the answer. Blocks can be collapsed by adding the minus sign (-) after the callout tag.

> [!warning]
> Use "warning" callout blocks to draw attention to things which may cause confusion.
> 
> This callout type does not require a custom title, but please consider whether it would improve the reading experience.

>[!error] Incorrect
>Use "error" callout blocks when showing incorrect examples.
>
>**Must always be followed by a correct example!**

>[!success] Correct
>Use "success" callout blocks when showing correct examples, but **only** after an incorrect example.
