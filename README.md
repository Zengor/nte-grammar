# nte-grammar
A progressive grammar guide for Japanese, collaboratively developed by the 日本語と英語 discord server.

An [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault.

Outline and guidelines coming soon.

# Sync
The obsidian vault in this repository includes a plugin which hides a lot of the nitty-gritty details of git.

Open the sync sidebar by opening the command pallette (**ctrl+p**) and typing "open source control view".

"Staged Changes" are files which you want included in the sync.

"Changes" are files which have not yet been staged. Click the + button on each item to manually stage it. You can also click the "Stage All" button at the top to add all files immediately.

"Commit" marks all staged files as being part of a group of files you want to upload.

"Pull" downloads changes from the server; "Push" uploads your committed files.
