Before going into all the nitty-gritty of Japanese, it's probably best to have a refresher on some of the words that are going to be used to describe things/parts of a sentence.  Some of you might already have a grasp on the basics of these grammar-y words, but others might not; so if you already do: feel free to skip ahead if you feel like you don't need the refresher.

For everyone that's still here: Japanese, much like English, has distinct parts that make up a sentence.  Each part has a name that helps us talk about what the part is and its role in the sentence.

There are 6 key parts that we're going to cover over the next few lessons and we feel it's important you know the meaning of the words we're going to use beforehand.  Those 6 parts are: -
-Noun
-Adjective
-Verb
-Subject
-Object
-Clause

Let's have a look at what these are and what they mean.

__Noun__
A noun is basically a thing that you can point/refer to and talk about.  I remember in school I was taught that "noun" is basically the same as "name" - they identify things that exist in the world or otherwise.

France
Unicorn
Tree
Idea
Literature

All those words are nouns and they identify a thing that we can talk about.

__Adjective__
An adjective is a word that describes a noun - they're words that tell us about the features and qualities of the noun.  Using the same nouns we had above, we can build on them using some adjectives.

France is [big]
Unicorns are [magical]
Trees are [green] 
Ideas are [abstract]
Literature is [interesting]

All the bracketed words are adjectives and they're describing the nouns.

__Verb__
A verb is a word that shows action; it shows that a noun is _doing something_.  A common way of saying what a verb is when I was in school was "a doing word".  Again, we can use the nouns from above to show what we mean.

France is [helping] Germany
Unicorns [run] through the forest
The trees [blow] in the wind
That idea [sounds] good
I am [studying] Literature

So fundamentally they're showing that some noun is _doing_ something. 

__Subject__
With the 3 parts above covered, we can start talking more specifically about the mechanics of a sentence.  The first of these is what's called the subject. 

The subject of a sentence is the thing that's doing the verb.  Let's look at one of the sentences above:

[France] is helping Germany

France is the noun that is actively doing the helping - it's not simply receiving it; so in this sentence France is the subject since it's the noun _doing_ the helping.

[I] am studying Literature

Here, I is the subject since that's what is _doing_ the studying.

See if you can identify what the subjects are in the other sentences.

__Object__
The object of a sentence is the thing that the verb is being done to - it's basically on the opposite side to the subject.  The subject _does_ something, and the object _has something done to it_.

Using the sentences from above we can show this more clearly:

France is helping [Germany]

The object here is Germany since they're the ones _being helped_.  The helping is _being done to Germany_.

I am studying [Literature]

And again here, the object is Literature since that's the thing _being studied_.  

__Clause__
The last of the main parts to cover here is a clause.  We've been saying "sentence" so far and I think we all have a general understanding of what a sentence is.  A clause gets a bit more technical as it can overlap with our general idea of a sentence sometimes.
