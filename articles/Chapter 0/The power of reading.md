You do not need to understand everything you read; quantity over quality will serve you best

Manga/Anime: highly recommended for all levels; perhaps the best source of input for beginners

Novels: great for early intermediate and beyond

Visual novels: high average difficulty, but there are lots of good tools which can help

Audiobooks/podcasts: only recommended for advanced learners due to low supporting context

Music: not recommended for study purposes at all
